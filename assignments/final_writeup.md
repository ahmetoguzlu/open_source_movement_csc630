# Final Project Write-Up

In order to summarize your work for the last few weeks, please create a short (less than or equal to two pages) report which discusses, in essence, why you feel like you accomplished each of the rubric metrics in the [project handout.](https://nzufelt.github.io/open_source_movement_csc630/assignments/Project.html).  You may include links to commits or pull requests as needed.  There is no need to be concerned about overselling your work here: everyone else won't be concerned about it, and it's an important skill to exercise.  Please include in a PDF file:
 
 * your name
 * a link to your repo, and, one final time, a one-sentence description of the project (its _tagline_)
 * a short discussion for each bullet point in the project handout.

This serves as the actual way by which you will "submit" your final project.
